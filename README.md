#  Air Quality Forecasting using Time Series Machine Learning Models  

##  Project Overview  
This project develops time series machine learning models to forecast air quality levels (**PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3**) in Beijing.  

The dataset contains **hourly measurements from 12 cities (2013–2017)**, including meteorological factors such as temperature, pressure, rainfall, and wind speed.  

The main objective is to predict pollutant concentrations using **time series forecasting methods** and evaluate their ability to capture seasonal pollution patterns.

##  Objectives  
- Preprocess and clean historical air quality data.  
- Engineer features from temporal and meteorological variables.  
- Train multiple forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, ML, Deep Learning).  
- Evaluate and compare model performance using error metrics.  
- Visualize actual vs predicted pollutant levels.  
- Interpret results and discuss implications for forecasting air pollution trends.

##  Dataset  
- **Source:** Hourly atmospheric measurements (2013–2017), Beijing, China.  
- **Variables:**  
  - **Target pollutants:** PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3  
  - **Features:** Temperature, pressure, dew point, rainfall, wind speed, wind direction  
- **Granularity:** Hourly data (resampled to daily averages where needed)

##  Methodology  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handle missing values (interpolation, forward/backward fill).  
- Detect and treat outliers.  
- Convert timestamps to `datetime` format.  
- Resample to daily/hourly frequency as required.  
- Train-test split:  
  - **Train:** 2013–2016  
  - **Test:** 2017  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Trend & seasonality plots.  
- Correlation heatmaps (pollutants vs weather).  
- Seasonal decomposition.  
- Distribution of pollutants across time & seasons.  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- **Time-based features:** hour, day, month, holidays  
- **Lag features:** pollutant levels from previous hours/days  
- **Rolling statistics:** moving averages, rolling variance  
- **Cyclical encoding:** sine/cosine transforms for periodic features  
- **Meteorological inputs:** wind speed, rainfall, temperature, etc.  

### 4. Modeling Approaches  
- **Classical Models:** ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- **Deep Learning Models (optional):** LSTM, GRU  

### 5. Model Training & Tuning  
- Hyperparameter optimization (grid search / cross-validation).  
- Compare performance across models and pollutants.  

### 6. Evaluation Metrics  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)  
- AQI classification accuracy (optional)  

### 7. Visualization  
- Actual vs Predicted pollutant levels  
- Forecast uncertainty intervals  
- Residual analysis  
- Feature importance (ML models)  

## Results & Discussion  
- Compare classical vs ML vs deep learning models.  
- Highlight best-performing models for PM2.5 (most critical pollutant).  
- Discuss seasonality patterns and meteorological influence.  
- Strengths & limitations of each approach.

## Bonus Extensions  
- Ensemble models (hybrid ARIMA + ML).  
- Spatial-temporal analysis (cross-city correlations).  
- Dashboard for forecast visualization (Plotly Dash / Streamlit).  
- Integration with live AQI APIs for real-time forecasting.
